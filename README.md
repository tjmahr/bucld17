# Spoken word recognition of children with cochlear implants

Research compendium for our presentation at the 42nd annual Boston University Conference on Language Development.

## Repository contents

`01-data-screening.Rmd` ([output](./01-data-screening.md)) screens the raw 
eyetracking data, removing trials and participants with excessive missing data.

`02-plot-data.Rmd` ([output](./02-plot-data.md)) includes various plots of the eyetracking 
data from the experiment. We had equivocated about how we would go about revealing the plots through 
the presentation so a lot of options are covered. This file also computes descriptives 
stats and prepares by-group plots of test scores.

`03-models.Rmd` ([output](./03-models.md)) runs growth curve analyses
for the data.

> Children with cochlear implants (CIs) perform more poorly
than normal hearing (NH) children on virtually every aspect of
speech and language. While these deficits have been attributed in
large part to the impoverished signal, children with CIs may also
have different processing strategies because of their consistent
experience of listening to an impoverished signal. We used the
mispronunciation paradigm to examine processing differences
in word recognition. 26 children with CIs (age: 31–66 months)
were compared to NH children matched for age and sex.
Children with CIs recognized one-feature mispronunciations as
reliably as their NH peers, but it took them longer to look away
from the familiar image. They were also slower and less reliable
at recognizing highly familiar words, even in a two-image LWL
paradigm. These results suggest that the impoverished signal
of the CI may result in more uncertainty and longer lexical
decision times, especially for ambiguous speech cues.
